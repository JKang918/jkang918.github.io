## Core Concept: Firm Value = A + B

Firm value is essentially the sum of the value of the firm’s operations and its accumulated wealth—specifically, *accumulated cash (also referred to as Net Non-Operating Assets, or accumulated debt if negative)*.


- **A: Value of Operations**  
  This refers to the operating cash flow (CFO, EBIT, EBITDA, NOPAT, etc.) generated by invested capital (OA - OL = net OA) and minus the cost of capital (WACC).

  > Notation
  - CFO: (*Cash Flow from Operation*)
  - EBIT: (*Earnings Before Interest and Tax*)
  - EBITDA: (*EBIT + Depreciation and Amortization*)
  - NOPAT: (*Net Operating Profit After Tax*)
  - OA: (*Operating Assets*)
  - OL: (*Operating Liabilities*)
  - WACC: (*Weighted Average Cost of Capital*)

- **B: Accumulated Cash (or Debt) (= Net Non-Operating Assets or Net Financial Debt)**

The cash or shortage thereof that has already been accumulated refers to the current cash position of the company, determined by Net Operating Assets (NOA) minus Debt.


With the concept of "firm value" well established, the companies can be classified as follows:


|                               | Low Cash Holdings                                                                            | High Cash Holdings                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Strong Operations Outlook** | (2) Risky but Watch-worthy  <br> - High debt risk  <br> - Strong operations, monitor closely | (1) Best Position  <br> - Already well recognized  <br> - May be fully valued  |
| **Weak Operations Outlook**   | (4) Avoid  <br> - High debt and poor outlook  <br> - Likely to worsen                        | (3) Low Investment Appeal  <br> - Ample cash now  <br> - Weak growth prospects |


- **(1) Best Position:**  
  Firms with both high cash and a strong outlook. Safest investments, but may already be expensive.

- **(2) Risky but Watch-worthy:**  
  Strong operations but low cash (often due to high debt). Risky, but could improve if leverage is managed.

- **(3) Low Investment Appeal:**  
  Plenty of cash but a weak business outlook. Financially stable for now, but lacks growth; not attractive.

- **(4) Avoid:**  
  Both poor outlook and low cash (high debt). Generally, the riskiest firms—should be avoided.


Whether the invested capital generates operating cash flow depends on:

- **Sales Analysis:** Rational forecasts based on understanding the market and industry.
- **Cost Analysis:** Analysis and rational forecasts of the cost structure (fixed costs, variable costs, etc.)

In simpler words, to understand the value of operations we need to look at whether the company **1. earns well** and **2. spends less**.

Based on this, the analysis can be broken down into the following five steps:

## Five-Step Analytical Framework

### Step 1. **NOA - Debt = Net NOA (or Net Debt)**
- Assess the current status:
  - If positive: Net Non-Operating Assets
  - If negative: Net Financial Debt

This is the current "cash-richness" we referred to.

### Step 2. **Operating Assets (OA) – Operating Liabilities (OL) = Invested Capital (IC)**
- Assess the current operational situation.
- Calculate Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).
- Identify Impairments (inventory, PPE, intangibles) (see: turnover, negative Net Income/EBIT/EBITDA).
- Detect fraudulent sales (see: turnover).

This is how much the company "earns" part.

### Step 3. **Income Forecasting** *(from Income Statement)*

- **Gross Profit**
- **Sales Forecasting and Analysis:** Market share, industry, competitors, macro trends, etc.
- **CGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Forecasting and Analysis:** Variable cost/fixed cost structure, etc.
- **Operating Margin**
- **Selling & Administrative (S&A) Expenses**
- **Net Income (NI) Margin (Non-Recurring Events):**
  - Non-recurring events: not important.
  - Recurring events (e.g., FX transaction or translation gain/loss): important.

This is how much the company has "spends" part.

### Step 4. **Cash Flow Analysis**
*(Does the company generate enough cash to cover costs?)*

- Compare CFO (Cash Flow from Operations) and NI:
  - Principle: CFO > NI
- **Order-Based Industries (e.g., construction):**
  - CFO ≠ NI, may vary. If CFO < NI persists, may indicate issues (e.g., collection problems, fabricated sales, or flawed revenue recognition).
- **Service Industries:** 
  - CFO ≈ NI, little difference due to low depreciation.

- Compare CFO and CFI (reinvestment in tangible assets):
  - CFO > reinvestment: Sufficient cash flow.
  - CFO < reinvestment: Borrowings required; depends on profitability.

This is how much the company generates cash flow to cover its costs.

### Step 5. **Related Party Transactions**

- Tunneling (favorable business deals to affiliates—check shareholder composition of affiliates)
- Embezzlement (watch for loans and loss reserves to non-audited affiliates)
- Other warning signs (e.g., frequent name changes)

These are some other information we need to take closer look at.

## Step 1. **NOA - Debt = Net NOA (or Net Debt)**

### 1) Check Non-Operating Assets

- Accumulated cash (from operating surplus) is considered as non-operating assets (“excess cash”).
- If future cash flow from operations cannot cover cash outflow for reinvestment in tangible assets, the company will gradually consume its non-operating assets.
- In practice, “excess cash” is treated as non-operating, and cash used for operations is considered operating assets. However, for valuation, it’s common practice to treat all cash as non-operating.

#### Types of Financial Assets

- Be careful—account names vary; check notes for details. Don’t worry too much about FVPL, FVOCI distinctions; use book value.
- Exception: When analyzing banks, e.g., the Silicon Valley Bank case—large fair value losses on HTM assets could mean capital erosion.

##### Examples:
- Cash and Cash Equivalents
- Short-Term Financial Assets
- Long-Term Financial Assets
- Investment Real Estate* 
  - Manufacturing:  
    - Operating real estate (PPE) is assumed not to be for sale (going concern).
  - Services:  
    - Even if the property is used as an office, if the capital gain is substantial, moving out is an option—possible to monetize.

---

### 2) Check Borrowings (Non-Operating Liabilities, Financial Debt)

- Distinguish operating liabilities from financial debt. Borrowings and bonds are financial debt; the rest is operating liabilities.
- Compare non-operating assets with financial debt:
  - If financial debt far exceeds non-operating assets, the company is in a state where paying off debt is the focus. If operations are unprofitable, debt will likely increase.



##### Examples:
- Borrowings: Check notes for short-term borrowings, long-term borrowings, current portion of long-term borrowings
- Bonds
- Mezzanine: Financially strong companies rarely issue these—consider dilution risk.
  - CB (Convertible Bonds)
    - Issuers aim to improve financial structure, assuming the funds will enhance firm value.
    - Investors want upside participation and downside protection.
    - Risk: If funds are misused (e.g., embezzled through affiliates), leads to capital erosion and bankruptcy.
  - BW (Bonds with Warrants)
  - RCPS (Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares)
    - Redeemable preferred stock: if it has a put option, count as debt; otherwise, equity.
    - Conversion features may also affect classification (derivative liability).


**Conclusion:**  
- Net Non-Operating Assets = Non-Operating Assets – Debt
  - If > 0: The company is cash-rich and, if operations are sound, excellent.
  - If < 0: The company lacks cash; if operations falter, debt will increase.

Ultimately, you must also evaluate “how well is the company making money?”; the value of its operations.

## Step 2. Operating Assets & Liabilities

### Key Metrics

- **ROIC: Return on Invested Capital**  
  After-tax operating profit (NOPAT = Operating Income (OI) × (1 – τ)) / Net Operating Assets (= Operating Assets – Operating Liabilities). (τ being the tax rate here.)
  - **Note:** ROA - Return on Asset (Operating Income/Total Assets) includes non-operating assets in the denominator—may be biased. ROIC is a better measure.
  - In services, denominator may be very low, so ROIC can appear very high; don’t compare directly to manufacturing; consider which industry the company of interest belongs to.

- **ROE: Return on Equity**  
  EBIT (excluding Non-Controlling Interest (NCI)) / Avg. Equity (excluding NCI).

### Impairment Issues 

Check whether the operating assets are impaired. 

- **Inventory (LCM—Lower of Cost or Market):**  
  - If business slows, inventory impairment occurs.
    - Trend changes create obsolete inventory.
    - Component suppliers hit if big clients lower raw material prices.
    - Physical damage or recalls also cause losses.

- **PPE (Property, Plant, Equipment) Impairment:**  
  - If business deteriorates, asset impairment risk rises. If negative earnings persist, asset impairments become likely (e.g., Q3 losses could mean Q4 asset write-downs).
  - US GAAP: Compare undiscounted future cash flows to book value for impairment, and use fair market value for quantifying loss.

- **Intangible Asset Impairment:**  
  - Goodwill: Under US GAAP, do a qualitative assessment to decide on impairment testing, and if FMV is below book, write down the asset.
  - R&D impairment per IFRS.

- **Deferred Tax Asset Impairment:**  
  - Profitable companies don’t need analysis.
  - If profits dim, deferred tax assets may be written off since future profits may not be enough to realize the benefit.

- **Fabricated Sales (Fake Revenue):**
  - Revenue recognition: contract, performance obligation, transaction price, allocation, satisfaction.
  - Warning signs: Large A/R balance relative to sales, high A/R allowance, past evidence of fake sales. (A/R stands for account receivables.)
  - Related-party sales (channel stuffing) should also be checked.

## Step 3. Maximizing Profits: Income Statement Analysis

We are scanning the income statement from the top to bottom.

### 1. Gross Profit Margin Analysis

- High in pharma, bio, and consumer goods; low in manufacturing.

#### Sales
- **Sales = Price × Quantity**
  - Pricing power depends on market share, brand, and industry (pharma, food, telecom, government-backed companies often lack pricing power).

#### CGS

- Extract DM (Direct Materials), DL (Direct Labor), MOH (Manufacturing Overhead, i.e., depreciation) by company and industry to see which costs dominate.
- Fixed cost heavy: e.g., SK Hynix
- Variable cost heavy: e.g., S-OIL (oil price sensitivity), airlines (fuel costs), Kangwon Land (labor costs).

> The examples are Korean companies but the principal of analysis applies to all companies.

If DM is high but company can pass on price increases (strong market share), margins can be preserved. Product price trends can be checked in the notes.

### 2. Sales and Administration Expenses → Operating Margin Analysis

- Sales expense, admin expense, R&D expense. 
- In pharmaceuticals, rebates are included in S & A, so gross profit margin may be a better focus.
- In consumer goods, focus on sales expense (distribution costs), as production cost savings (CGS) have little effect.

### 3. Accounts Located Below Operating Income

- If operating income and net income don’t differ much, further analysis is less valuable.
- However, recurring and/or significant differences require analysis; ignore one-off items.

**Examples of other items:**
- **Equity Method Gains/Losses:** Not essential unless evaluating asset value.
- **Financial Income & Expense:** High interest expense not covered by operating income suggests financial distress.
- **Other Gains/Losses:** Recurring items (e.g., FX, asset disposals) may matter; one-offs (e.g., donations) can be excluded from fundamental analysis.

## Step 4. Cash Flow Statement Analysis

- For shareholders: Is enough earned for residual returns?
- For creditors: Is enough earned to service debt?

### EBITDA Caveats

- EBITDA = Net Income (NI) + Depreciation + Amortization
- Must check breakdowns in “nature of costs”—depreciation is split between S&A and CGS, as is labor. (*)
- **EBITDA is only useful if A/R collections are normal and depreciation is the main non-cash expense.**
- Cash flow statement is the best tool for checking company health.

> (*) Accounts can be categorized by function or by nature. Depreciation is classified as a "by nature" account whereas financial statements are prepared by function. Depreciation expense is allocated and included in various functional categories such as cost of goods sold, selling expenses, or administrative expenses. That’s why you don’t see a separate “depreciation” line in function-based statements.

### Cash Flow Statement Overview

#### Operating Activities (CFO):

- **Principle:** CFO > NI (same logic as EBITDA > NI)
- Exception: Order-based industries (construction, shipbuilding, etc.) may have irregular operating cash flows due to the percentage-of-completion method.
- Service industry: CFO ≈ NI (especially if company doesn’t own its office).

#### Investing Activities (CFI):

- CFO > PPE investment: Ideal, free cash flow scenario (e.g., Samsung Electronics).
- CFO > PPE investment: But investments must yield returns, or trouble will follow.
- CFO < PPE investment: Could be bold reinvestment, but risky if returns don’t materialize; be cautious with small-cap companies.

#### Financing Activities (CFF):

- If CFO is strong, investment and shareholder returns are both positive.
- If CFO is weak but CFI (investment) is aggressive, CFF (borrowings) must support it—if this continues, the company’s financial health may deteriorate.

#### Summary

In summary, a healthy company typically generates cash from operations (+), uses this cash to invest in its business (-), and then pays interest and dividends, and occasionally repays debt (-) with the remaining funds.

On the other hand, an unhealthy company generally fails to generate cash from operations (-), survives by selling off its assets (+), and, lacking cash, continues to accumulate more debt over time (+).

## Step 5. Red Flags

- **Tunneling:**  
  - Buying from or selling to affiliates at unfair prices, transferring profits.
  - Always check shareholder structure in notes.
- **Suspicious Loans:**  
  - Loans to non-listed affiliates, with little transparency, can indicate embezzlement.
- **Convertible Bonds + Affiliate Lending Patterns:**  
  - Issue CB, use proceeds to fund “hot” affiliate, then embezzle through salaries/expenses.
- **Frequent Changes in Major Shareholder, CEO, or Company Name:**  
  - Indicates instability—check company history in annual reports.

So check for..
- Convertible bond issuance decisions, bond with warrants issuance, changes in capital.
- Notes on loans, related party transactions.

> Note that some of above might not be common red flags in other countries than Korea.

## Conclusion

Under the fundamental premise that a firm's value is the sum of the value of its operations and the value of its existing assets, a framework for estimating these two components has been presented. In practice, however, valuation is a complex process that requires a thorough understanding of each company’s unique financial statements and circumstances.

Nevertheless, despite the complexities and nuances of real-world valuation, most approaches ultimately operate within this fundamental framework.
