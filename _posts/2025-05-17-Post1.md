Hello and welcome.

I am a finance professional currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Operations Research at Georgia Tech, following several years of experience as a credit analyst at a Korean credit rating agency. There, I specialized in analyzing ABS backed by a wide range of underlying assets. I am currently working as a Summer Associate at a Korean investment bank based in New York (sell-side). Areas I am focusing on as of now are CLOs and leveraged loans.

This blog is dedicated to exploring topics at the intersection of finance, law, and engineering — with a focus on ABS, structured finance, and private credit markets in both Korea and the U.S. I will also share insights into key quantitative disciplines such as optimization and stochastic processes, as well as practical computing tools including Excel (Power Query, VBA), Microsoft BI tools (Power BI), Python, and SQL.

I hope this blog serves as a valuable resource for professionals and students navigating the evolving landscape of modern finance.
